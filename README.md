==================

Playing around with ReactJS and RxJS

Installing
----------

You'll need react-tools:

```$ [sudo] npm install -g react-tools```

And Bower:

```
$ [sudo] npm install -g bower
```

And some components (from the project's root folder):

```
$ npm install
$ bower install
```

Running
-------

```$ NODE_PATH=`pwd` node main.js```

Developing
----------

```$ gulp```

* Every JSX file will automatically be compiled to a JS file in the same folder
