==================

Playing around with React.js from Facebook

Installing
----------

You'll need JSX as a global NPM module:

```$ [sudo] npm install -g jsx```

And Bower components:

```
$ cd assets
$ bower install
```

Running
-------

Execute from the project's root folder:

```$ ./run```

* A server will start up at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
* Every JSX file will automatically be compiled to a JS file in the same folder
